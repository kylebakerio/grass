How to make parallax?

## in THREE builtin?:

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/22370 <-- supposedly this exists in THREE (we're not using the latest build, so it hasn't been removed for us yet; this should mean it is here--how do we implement this, and maybe how can we get lighting support added?)

## Another THREE library that may make it easier, perhaps..?
